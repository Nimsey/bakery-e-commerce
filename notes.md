express.urlencoded() Middleware: This is a built-in middleware function in Express. It parses incoming requests with URL-encoded payloads. A URL-encoded payload is sent from the client to the server in the HTTP request body, and it is commonly used by HTML forms.

{ extended: false } Option: The extended option is a configuration that dictates how the URL-encoded data is parsed.

When set to false, it uses the querystring library to parse URL-encoded data.
When set to true, it uses the qs library for parsing. The qs library allows for richer objects and arrays to be encoded into the URL-encoded format, offering more capabilities than querystring.
In most cases, especially for simpler or less complex data structures, extended: false is sufficient.

Purpose and Use: The middleware parses the incoming request's body and makes the data available under the req.body property. This is useful when you're processing form submissions or any other scenario where your client sends data in the URL-encoded format.



Install and set up your chosen database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL).
Configure Sequelize to connect to your database.
2. Design Your Database Schema
Define Models:

User Model: To store user information.
Task Model: To store task information, including fields for description, priority, and creator ID (foreign key to User model).
Associations:

Define associations between Users and Tasks (e.g., one User can have many Tasks).
3. Create RESTful API Endpoints
User Endpoints:

Create Users: POST /users
List Users: GET /users
Task Endpoints:

Create Task: POST /tasks (should include user ID, task description, and priority)
List Tasks: GET /tasks
Update Task: PUT /tasks/:id
Delete Task: DELETE /tasks/:id
4. Implementing Features
Task Creation and Display:

When creating a task, store the user ID along with other task details.
When displaying tasks, include the creator's information and priority.
Prioritization:

Allow tasks to be marked as 'low' or 'high' priority.
5. Frontend (Optional)
If you are also creating a frontend, you can use any JavaScript framework/library like React, Vue.js, or just plain HTML/CSS/JavaScript.
Make sure to handle API requests properly to interact with your backend.
6. Testing and Debugging
Test each API endpoint using tools like Postman or through your frontend.
Debug and fix any issues that arise.
7. Documentation
Write clear documentation for your API endpoints and database schema.
This helps in understanding and maintaining the codebase.
Additional Tips
Use version control (like Git) to manage your code.
Keep your code modular and well-organized.
Ensure to handle errors and edge cases in your application.
